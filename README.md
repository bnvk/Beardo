# Beardo
Did you know beards could tell time? No truly, Beards are a magical wonder of nature. Much like the rings of old growth tree, each and every beard contains a unique record of the health and life lived by the beard grower. Was the grower properly nourished throughout the cold winter months? Do they have a health sex life? Do they drink too much alcohol? A good proper full beard knows all. 

Since I am one of those of those rare individuals who suffer from Beard envy, in that I cannot really grow a proper beard, I decided to make a prosthetic beard- or rather an experiment in open data and time tracking / invoicing software that keeps record of my work and activities.
